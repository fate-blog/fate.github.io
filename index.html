        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Wash and boil the 1kg protein of choice, add little to no water first, add 4 cubes of maggi knorr, add some thyme, curry, salt to taste, blend 2 large onions, little garlic and ginger, and pour/mix in boiling meat. Stir and allow to cook for 15-20 minutes in low heat. After which you should use a filter and separate the broth from the cooked protein. <strong> (keep broth in a container for now, do not throw away). </strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Blend Fresh tomatoes with fresh pepper, ginger and garlic, bell peppers, scotch bonnet and 4 large pepper together. <br><em>Blend another 3 large onions seperately.</em><br>
Put a clean pot on fire and boil the blended Tomatoes and peppers inside and allow to cook until thick and the water is almost dried, boil in medium heat. <strong> Do not boil with the seperately blended 3 large onions. (keep seperate for now.)</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Put frying pan/pot on fire, pour in oil, allow oil to get hot and put in protein, allow to fry in medium heat <em>until protein is golden/brown color. </em>
</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Use oil from frying the protein to start cooking. <br> <ul> <li>
Pour oil into clean empty pot, when it gets hot, pour in blended onion and allow to fry in low heat for 5 minutes, keep stiring until onion looks thick.
<li> Pour in Tin/canned tomatoes and allow to fry with the onions for at least 10 minutes in low heat, keep frying until the combo has a 'sweeet' taste.
<li> Pour in the cooked blended Fresh tomatoes and pepper mix. Allow to cook for a couple of minutes while stiring,Pour in Broth and cook in low heat.  
<li> Put all the neccesary spices and ingrediendts, salt to taste, 3 cubes of maggi knorr, white pepper, paprika, and add a little butter. Mix and stir and allow to cook for about 5-8 minutes in low heat.
<li> If you want to sauce the protein, this is your opportunity to sauce it and remove it and keep seperate before the next step. Add a little water if broth is too thick, and if you think the stew is too much, remove some and keep in a container, (You might need it later).
    
</ul>  <strong>  </strong>
</p>
 <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Wash the rice thoroughly and repeatedly for at least 4 times. <strong> (Do not perboil the Rice). </strong> Pour in Rice to the boiling sauce/stew on fire, mix together, put in bay leaf, and cover with foil paper. <br> Allow to cook for at least 20 minutes in low heat, open and taste, add more spices you think its lacking, pour in the separated sauce/stew if Rice is completely dried and not done. No need to mix or stir yet. Cover in foil and allow to cook for another 10 minutes, put more butter to give it extra Shine, stir and your Tasty Jollof should be ready by now!
</p>  
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Serve with chicken and step it down with a cold Fresh Orange Juice! <strong> <em>Enjoy!</em> </strong> </p>

        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong>

Grind the four cups of egusi with a dry blender or hand-grinding machine and set them aside in a bowl. Add ground melon to a bowl, add about a cup of water and mix to form a paste then set aside. Wash and chop the spinach, drain in a colander and set aside.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> 
Parboil the meat with all the ingredients, it is advisable to parboil meat with some ingredients before adding them to the principal food, this improves the taste of the meat.

</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong>
Parboil for about ten minutes, then add water and cook till the meat is tender and the stock (water) is about to dry. Use two seasoning cubes, a teaspoon of salt and a half cup of sliced onions.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong>
Pour hot water over the stockfish in a bowl and wash thoroughly to remove sand, then set aside. Also, remove the center bone from the roasted fishes, wash and set aside too.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> 
Place a big pan on medium heat, add palm oil and heat for about 3 minutes (Do not bleach oil) add the reserved chopped onions and Sautee till translucent
Add pepper mix, locust beans and stir to combine. Bring to boil for 5 minutes.
Add the egusi paste in bits to pepper, reduce the heat, do not stir and cover the pot with a lid. Cook for another 10 minutes.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong>
Remove the lid, and gently stir the soup. The egusi would be lumpy at this point, use the back of a ladle to break the lumps it into desired size/texture
Add smoked turkey, ground crayfish and crayfish, beef stock (if using) and stir to combine. Add bouillon cubes, taste and adjust accordingly. I didnâ€™t add salt to this soup as the smoked turkey and mackerel already contained salt. Continue to cook for another 10 minutes, check at intervals and stir to avoid burning if need be.
Add shredded smoked mackerel and gently stir into the soup. Add chopped spinach, stir to combine and cook for another 3 to 5 minutes. Take it off the heat, allow to cool for about 10 minutes before serving
</p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong>
Serve and enjoy with any Nigerian swallow of choice, you can even serve over white rice. Not afraid to try new things?  cool, then we are related. you may also enjoy this soup with freshly baked Agege bread.

        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Soften the ice cream and chill the glass. Take the ice cream out of the freezer for 10 to 15 minutes before use. At the same time, place your glass in the freezer. This will keep the shake cold when you serve it.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Measure the ingredients. 1 cup ice cream to 1/4 cup milk is a great ratio.

</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Blend the shake. In a blender, combine the milk and ice cream and blend until smooth. Add any your mix-ins and blend them in to your desired consistency.

</p>
        <p><strong>Step 4:</strong>Serve. Pour the shake into the chilled glass and serve immediately.
